## ℹ️ About Me

I'm a person who's been into electronics and software long before I created this account here. I've studied IT-architecture for 3½ years, which further expanded my existing skills within IT. 

My main interest is developing software that fulfills a purpose and is safe to use, and to that, I tend to focus on the minute details and spot threats, vulnerabilities or even discrepancies when referring to internal standards or protocols for development. This is a result of having built and troubleshooted PCs and tinkered from a young age, where I'd have some sort of "protocols" to achieve the desired knowledge about defects or errors - an abductive approach, to say the least.

I focus on information architecture and technological architecture, but I most certainly can focus on enterprise architecture too - whenever necessary.

I can dissect issues and fit them to the needs of companies/organizations, developing business process mappings, that are also to be observed throughout the software produced. Managing projects is frankly, also a part of my skillset, in which I make use of well-known techniques and standards of doing so, including Scrum, Kanban and eventually Prince2.

As part of my studies, I gave machine learning a try and got to know Pandas and Tensorflow - Python in general was already known to me since 2017, although I do not use it as much.

Descriptions of some of my projects, and the technologies I've worked with before, will be listed below.

## 👨‍💻 Projects

| Project               | Description |
| --------------------- | ----------- |
| **Microservices-project** | Based on a case of an auction house, in which I contributed interviews to a bigger analysis of the user experience of common auction houses. Domain Driven Design (DDD) was used to identify the necessary services.<br><br>This resulted in a project consisting of 5 microservices, that use RabbitMQ for communication and MongoDB as a database - all deployed as Azure containers using bicep scripts. |
| **Reddit clone**          | Having to construct a barebone with the same functionality as Reddit (threads, comments, up- & downvotes), I created a clone individually, using Entity Framework to store data in an SQLite database.<br><br>The frontend was developed using BlazorWASM (C#/.NET), and was made to be a SPA (Single Page App), which communicated with an API to perform actions on backend - this did not include authentication. |
